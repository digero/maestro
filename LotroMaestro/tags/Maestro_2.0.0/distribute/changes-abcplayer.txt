Todo:
  - Separate LotroInstruments.sf2 from the installer. Make it a download.
  - ABC visualization.
 
 Version 1.3.1
 NEW FEATURES
   - Added an option to show the full name of each part in the track list, without 
     trimming off the song name from the start.
   - The volume now goes to eleven! The maximum volume is a bit louder than it 
     used to be.
 
 Version 1.3.0
 NEW FEATURES
  - Added support for the Pibgorn instrument. There are several notes that play 
    at the wrong pitch to match the broken behavior of the Pibgorn in the game.
  - Added a Solo button [S] to let you easily listen to a single part solo without 
    having to mute the rest of the tracks.
  - The instrument dropdown is now sorted by name.

BUG FIXES
  - The +pppp+ and +ffff+ dynamics specifiers should no longer cause errors.

Version 1.2.2
BUG FIXES
  - ABC Player now works with Java 6 Update 30+.
  - ABC Player's play speed should match LOTRO's play speed if a song has both 
    the M: and L: header fields specified.
  - The song position bar now lets you drag past 35:47 on long songs.

Version 1.2.0
  - You can now export songs directly to MP3! Requires the (free) LAME mp3 
    converter.
  - The volume slider is back. If you're using Windows Vista or Windows 7, 
    it will use the system's per-application volume (kept in sync with the 
    volume set for ABC Player in the system volume mixer).
  - When a long note is held on a woodwind instrument while stringed 
    instruments are playing many fast notes, the note on the woodwind should 
    no longer be cut off before it actually ends.
  - If the same note is repeated quickly on a woodwind instrument, the 
    difference between notes is sharper, and sounds more like it does in LOTRO.
  - Staccato (short) notes on woodwind instruments are more... staccato, to 
    sound more like they do in LOTRO.
  - Bagpipe drone notes (C, through B,) now sustain forever rather than fading 
    out after ~8 seconds, to match how they sound in LOTRO.
  - Changed the stereo effect to be less dependent on the order of the parts
    in the file, and more on the instrument used for the part. For example, 
    flute will always be panned to the left. If the same instrument is used in 
    multiple parts, the second part will be be panned to opposite speaker, 
    and the third part will be panned to the center.
  - If a part name includes the word "Left", it will always be panned to the
    left speaker. Likewise for the words "Right, and "Center" or "Middle".

Version 1.1.0
  - ABC Parse "warnings" for notes too low/high/short/long, chords with too 
    many notes, volume +dynamics+ inside chords.
  - Now in Stereo! In songs with multiple parts, the second and subsequent 
    parts are panned slightly to the right or left.
  - Added a tempo slider to adjust the tempo of playback. Right-click on 
    the slider to quickly toggle between 0% and 100%.
  - Removed the volume slider to reduce clutter, as it didn't seem very 
    useful.
  - You can now append additional parts to a song once it's already open, 
    including the same song multiple times.  Do one of the following:
    + Choose "Append ABC file(s)..." from the File menu
    + Choose "Append from clipboard" from the File menu if the file is on the 
      clipboard.
    + Hold down Ctrl and drag/drop the file onto ABC Player
  - You can now paste songs from the clipboard to open them. Use Ctrl+V to 
    create a new song using the text from the clipboard. Use Ctrl+Shift+V to 
    add the text from the clipboard to the current song (useful if pasting a 
    multi-part song from thefatlute.com, for example).
    You can also use Ctrl+V and Ctrl+Shift+V with actual .abc files, as an  
    alternative to dragging and dropping the files.
  - Added support for the following key signature modes in addition to 
    major and minor: 
    Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, Ionian, and Locrian.
  
  - ABC Player handles notes with incorrect octave markers (like c,, or A') 
    the same way that LOTRO does, rather than giving an error.  The comma 
    always lowers the octave and the apostrophe always raises the octave, 
    regardless of whether the note letter is upper or lower case.
  - Tuplets that contain chords should be the right length now.
  - Fixed an issue when determining the speed to play songs that have a meter 
    with a denominator that's not 4 (e.g. 6/8). Hopefully all songs should 
    play at the correct speed now.
  - Reduced the volmue difference between +ppp+ and +fff+. ABC Player's 
    volume dynamics should now more closely match LOTRO's.
  - Fixed the harp's ^a and b notes so they don't sound like clicks.
  - Occasionally when changing instruments, you'd hear the instruments 
    playing at full volume for a few seconds. This should no longer happen.
  - Removed the power of two restriction on the meter's denominator.
  - You can now change the instrument and see bar numbers even if the abc 
    file is missing the (required) "X:" line at the beginning.
  - ABC Player now ignores slurs () without generating errors, to mimic 
    LOTRO's behavior.
  - Playing a part that has note ties on the cowbell should no longer generate 
    erroneous note tie errors.
